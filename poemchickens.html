<h2 class="poemtitle">Chickens</h2>
<p class="Byline">Carol Prejean Zippert</p>
<p class="poem">
	She raised chickens.</br>
	She pampered the setting hens</br>
	that could be vicious when</br>
	guarding their nest.</br>
	And even when the chicks</br>
	were hatched, those mother hens</br>
	were ever vigilant over their brood</br>
	and my mother was ever vigilant</br>
	over her hens.</p>
<p class="poem">
	She ordered catalog chicks</br>
	when her Rhode Island Reds and big</br>
	White Rocks didn’t reproduce fast</br>
	enough.</br>
	The noisy chicks arrived in boxes</br>
	of 100.</p>

	<p class="poem">
	She collected newspapers for the</br>
	daily ritual of laying fresh</br>
	covering on the wire-mesh floors</br>
	of the little chicks’ cages.</br>
	She kept them warm and dry.</br>
	She removed the “pip” –</br>
	a mouth malady of chicks that</br>
	stopped their eating.</br>
	She was their nurse.</p>
<p class="poem">
	She raised chickens</br>
	to feed her large family.</br>
	So when the chicks had grown</br>
	to freezer size she blocked them</br>
	in the chicken yard and one by one</br>
	she wrung their necks</br>
	laying each on its back on a cross</br>
	she carved in the dust.</br>
	She claimed this brought the chickens</br>
	a peaceful death and allowed their</br>
	spirits to remain with the earth.</p>
<p class="poem">
	She raised chickens</br>
	and kept their yard raked clean,</br>
	their water dishes fresh and filled.</br>
	And she spoke gently with them</br>
	as she sprinkled their feed.</p>
<p class="poem">
	My mother raised chickens.</br>
	She nurtured them as her family.</br>
	My mother raised chickens to</br>
	help nurture her family.</p>
