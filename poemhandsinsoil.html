<h2 class="poemtitle">Hands in the Soil</h2>
<p class="Byline">Carol Prejean Zippert</p>
<p class="poem">
My daddy grew up with his hands</br>
in the soil</br>
The country-born son of sharecroppers</br>
he moved to town but he had to have</br>
his hands in the soil</br>
He just needed to be amongst</br>
up-turned earth</br>
He tilled the land for year-round</br>
gardens</br>
Planting vegetables, flowers and
herbs</br>
(The loud peppermint tea was my
favorite)</br>
His cabbage, squash, tomatoes</br>
and cayenne pepper bushes rivaled</br>
the roses and azaleas for color</br>
and show</br>
He tended vines along the fences</br>
and myriad of flowering greenery</br>
lined the yard and hugged the house</br>
My daddy grew up with his hands</br>
in the soil</br>
And sometimes he turned up the earth</br>
And planted nothing at all.</p>
