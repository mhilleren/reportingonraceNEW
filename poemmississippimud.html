<h2 class="poemtitle">Mississippi Mud</h2>
<p class="Byline">Carol Prejean Zippert</p>
<p class="poem">
  He said he was from Mississippi.</br>
  He wore a western hat and his</br>
  face flushed beet-red when I stepped on</br>
  his ego. I asked him to look at</br>
  himself but my words were rejected</br>
  in mid-air since he had not given me</br>
  permission to speak.</p>

	<p class="poem">
  He said he was from Mississippi.</br>
  He wore a dark shirt and a painted tie</br>
  and his eyes dripped venom when I</br>
  pointed to the white hood on his head.</br>
  He sat petrified but his rage reached</br>
  my throat to strangle in the truth that</br>
  he did still carry the lynching rope.</p>

<p class="poem">
  He said he was from Mississippi.</br>
  He wore his hair in a ponytail and his skin was</br>
  rusted and cracked from the dry southwest wind.</br>
  In his nakedness he slipped from his self-erected</br>
  pedestal no longer able to hide from the history</br>
  he told himself didn’t exist. He spat rocks</br>
  at me in punishment for his sins.</p>

<p class="poem">
He said he was from Mississippi.</br>
He wore fancy cowboy boots. And when I raised</br>
my hands to free my throat the fire of his breath</br>
kicked at my belly. But his punches struck only</br>
the barriers he built for both of us –</br>
barriers crumbling and scattering like dried</br>
Mississippi mud in a southwest wind.</p>
