	<p class="introduction">Churches like the Calvary Baptist Church, a historically black church in Madison, Ga., play a key role in the lives African Americans, including farmers. Such churches were places of worship, of course, but they also solidified a sense of community in an otherwise oppressive world, served as effective communications channels, and provided leadership and other guidance for African Americans on issues of the day.</p>

<p class="Subhead">Farming Through the Generations</p>
<p class="introduction">Dee Dotson has had farming in his blood for nearly a century. His nephew, Frank Taylor, sees a brighter future for rural America if small farmers do a better job of purchasing and selling in bulk and connecting with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and other agencies and groups. Dotson was co-founder of the Winston County Self Help Cooperative, based in Louisville, Miss., and Taylor is now president.</p>

<p class="Subhead">Seeds of Hope in the Shadow of Racism</p>
<p class="introduction">Despite a history marked by chattel slavery, Jim Crow laws, terrorism by lynching, unequal education, economic discrimination, institutional racism and more, African American farmers maintain a love of the land as deep as any citizen. Their determination to continue farming and earn sustainable livelihoods drives them to maintain their land for future generations and find new ways to compete in a changing agricultural system that hasn’t always been fair. They are acutely aware of that history, yet seem undaunted. </p>

Each jar is marked with the name of the murder victim and the date and location of the crime. The jars were collected as part of EJI’s Community Remembrance Project. In 2015, EJI released a report documenting 4,075 lynchings of black Americans in 12 Southern states between 1877 and 1950. Many of them were military veterans.</p>

The statue, a National Monument, shows Booker T. Washington removing a “veil of ignorance” from a slave, giving him light to read. Slaves generally were not allowed to read. The statue’s inscription reads: "He lifted the veil of ignorance from his people and pointed the way to progress through education and industry." Washington was Tuskegee’s first president.</p>

It has been handed down through several generations, and Cummings and other family members have struggled to keep it.</p>
